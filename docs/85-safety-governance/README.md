## What is Safety & Governance?

While **[Security & Privacy](../80-security-privacy/README.md)** protects user data and ensures compliance, **Safety & Governance** ensures the AI system itself behaves correctly:

| Security & Privacy | Safety & Governance |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Protects **data** (PII, encryption, auth) | Protects **behavior** (accuracy, refusals, consistency) |
| Prevents **breaches** | Prevents **mistakes** |
| GDPR, data retention, access control | Hallucination reduction, operational limits, quality assurance |
