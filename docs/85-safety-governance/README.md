# Safety & Governance

Comprehensive safety controls and governance frameworks for the Toll Aviation chatbot to ensure accurate, compliant, and trustworthy AI interactions.

## Overview

The Safety & Governance framework establishes systematic controls across multiple layers:

- **Technical Guardrails**: Automated validation and safety controls
- **Operational Limits**: Clear boundaries on what the chatbot can and cannot do
- **Compliance Controls**: Data protection and regulatory adherence
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous monitoring and improvement processes

This multi-layered approach ensures the chatbot operates safely within defined parameters while maintaining high-quality customer interactions.

## Core Principles

### Trust Through Transparency
- Every response must be traceable to approved source documents
- Clear citations and confidence indicators for all factual claims
- Explicit acknowledgment of limitations and uncertainties

### Safety First
- Refuse to provide flight operations or safety-critical guidance
- Escalate medical, legal, or operational questions to human experts
- Protect against prompt injection and misuse attempts

### Compliance by Design
- GDPR-compliant data handling with automatic PII detection
- Audit trails for all customer interactions
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
